Hi Gavin,
I intend to use the ST7789_TFT_RPI lib. The lib you did for me.
Is there a possibility to merge this into 2.0. Or should I stay with 1.3?
Regards
Jakob

Hi 

You are using Display_Lib_RPI not ST7789_TFT_RPI
ST7789_TFT_RPI is  the library I wrote for you.

The problem is:  that I upgraded 'Display_Lib_Rpi' from version 1.3.0 to Version 2.0.0. Last month.
So it will work on all Linux based Single board computers Including  Raspberry pi 5.  
'Display_Lib_Rpi'  version 2.0.0 may require a change to the 'spidev.bufsiz' setting  as specified in the st7789 readme.

Do you want to use Display_lib_RPI OR St7789_TFT_RPI ?
St7789_TFT_RPi is unchanged since last contact and should work fine.

Hi 

I have created a new version: 1.0.2 , which has support for hardware SPI-1 interface.
There are 3 hello world examples (one for SPI-0 , SPI-1 and software SPI)
The only difference is in setup*() function.
 The difference between SPI-0 and SPI-1 is the number of parameters for TFTInitSPI() function.
For SPI-1 there is no choice for CE pin.
I have noticed the speed of SPI-1 is ~50% of SPI-0, I don't know reason why , its not my library, its the bcm2835 library or
Raspberry pi configuration.
Pins used are in README table. 
I never used the SPI-1 before on any project.

Good evening Gavin,

Thank you for the response. Because i am only displaying Text, I guess Software SPI could do the job, right?
The Library as it is has NO option to use  SPI1 
It needs to be changed to use 'bcm2835_aux_spi_*'  functions instead of the  'bcm2835_spi_*'  from bcm2835 dependency library.
I have never used  'bcm2835_aux_spi_*' before but assuming it works it should be an easy job. 
The library does support  software SPI , but this is 20 times slower than 8MhZ Hardware SPI, the advantage of software SPI is you can 
Pick any GPIO you want. 
I can add an option to use SPI1 OR show you how to do software SPI(its shown in hello world example , function = SetupSWSPI()) 

This would be very helpful. 
Regards Jakob

Gavin,
I hope you got the money. With Paypal the conversion from Swiss Francs, went to US$ and then to EU. This ist the reason for the odd value.

As I confimed yesterday, all works. Thank you.

Right now I am struggling because I need to move the display from the SPI 0 channel to SPI 1.
I could you give me please give me a hint?
Below the Actual pin Config which works. 
Where do I make the all the changes to use SPI 1?

Thank you Jakob

Hi 

I have made a new library at https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/ST7789_TFT_RPI
You can test it and see how it works.
I think it will work for 240x320 but i am not certain.

Regards

Hi Gavin,
thank you for the quick response.

So you want a ST7789 Library for Raspberry pi 3 or 4 written in C++, 240x320 Landscape mode.
Yes


Note ::
I have a 240X280 display but the same code should work for 240x320.

Lets give a try with this version. I guess to change it to 240x320 should not be a ig issue.


The 'Display_Lib_RPI' library  does not work at present  with Raspberry pi 5 as the bcm2835 Library dependency its built on is not updated to work  on Raspberry pi 5.

I am aware of this. I am using RP4 ad CM4 with bookworm. Never seen any problem between the two platforms.
Regards Jakob

Gavin,
thank you for the response. The positive result lead me to ask you for some work.  I am able to pay a small amount for it.

I am planning to build a small series of devices that will help farmers to reduce the need for fertilizer in order to conserve drinking water. Our aim is to provide around 20-30 farmers with a low-cost device next spring.
We use a TFT display to show the operating status. 
240x320 in landscape mode.
I have discovered your Display_Lib_RPI library.
could you please adapt this library for the ST7789v to:
240x320 Landscape mode. Would this be possible for 100€
Our project is also open source https://github.com/jaluebbe/vigor22

Regards Jakob

Hi 

You can use command  TFTsetRotation(); to rotate the display.
https://gavinlyonsrepo.github.io/misc/software_docs/Display_Lib_RPI/classST7789__TFT.html#ab29a6496c729048a238ed3321a084641

See test 502 in example file Text_Graphics_Functions/main.cpp 
you have to edit the examples/color16_displays/Makefile To SRC=st7789/Text_Graphics_Functions to run this test file. As per main README test section.
 


regards.

Gavin, great to see what you have done. Thank you for the good description. It helped me to make it run for a st7788 to display Text.

I was searching in the code to find any hints how to change the text display from portrait to landscape mode.
Could you please give me hints wherei can do this?

Regards Jakob
